# Custom WordPress Theme Template

This WordPress theme template is designed for creating custom themes from scratch (Especially for building websites with Elementor).

</div>

---

- **Bootstrap Menu Integration**: Built using the Bootstrap menu navwalker, making it easy to create responsive menus. (Thanks for [https://github.com/wp-bootstrap/wp-bootstrap-navwalker](https://github.com/wp-bootstrap/wp-bootstrap-navwalker))
- **Integrated Bootstrap Styles and Scripts**: An integration with Bootstrap styles and scripts for a modern and responsive design.
- **Basic Page Templates**: Includes templates for pages both with and without containers, offering flexibility in your design.
- **Empty Enqueued Files**: Comes with empty `main.js` and `main.css` files that are ready for your custom scripts and styles.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This template includes ONLY basic page files (index.php, template-full-width.php, front-page.php and 404.php). If you want to create an archive or single pages you need to create them by own. (You can read the Wordpress documentation here - https://wordpress.org/documentation/). Also included pages have only basic markup for demonstration purpose. You need to edit it for your own purposes.
